# Deep Learning based Fall Detection using WiFi CSI
=> its a notebook containing the data to perform deep learning based fall detection using wifi channel state information

=> you don't need to add your dataset separately i have created a built in pipeline to download and split data automatically

=> the dataset we've used is called WiFall you can use other datasets also but you have to change the program aaccording to that

=> it is a very easy implementation done using custom CNN and biGRU

=> increase the number of epochs if you want better accuracy
